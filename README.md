# Large-Scale Learning with Fourier Features and Tensor Decompositions

This repository is the official implementation of [Large-Scale Learning with Fourier Features and Tensor Decompositions
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01545). 

## Requirements

Install the [GPLM toolbox](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/) for results related to the GPR benchmark.
All datasets except for the Airline dataset can be downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
The Airline dataset can be downloaded from the [Github of James Hensman](https://github.com/jameshensman/VFF). 

## Training and Evaluation

To train and test the models in the paper on the various datasets, it is sufficient to execute the corresponding homonymous scripts. All the necessary functions are located in the appropriate folder.
